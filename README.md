# e-vote
Documenting E-VOTE! for OSU CS 406 - Projects (and beyond).

The repository will be uploaded on a regular bases to show my progression.

NOTES
# July 2, 2020
- All candidates, positions, election days are accurate. Their personal information, especially SSN, are fictional and generated by a random generator found online. The same goes for Voters. Addresses may or may not be fictional but are close to being as accurate as possible to be realistic.
- Phone/cell datatype is now char(15) so numbers can be properly entered, including international numbers
- Zipcode datatype is now Char to capture the leading zero (i.e. 07373 would be entered as 7373 with Int)

# July 20, 2020
- Uploaded the DML file
- Uploaded the updated Web Design. As I was going through the DML, I realized some functionalities on the Web Design did not make sense so they were tweaked.

# July 27, 2020
- Uploaded the main.html, files for the code, 404 and 500 handlebars, and home.html (not active)
- Uploaded the written/drawn code layout and psuedocode for the Page 3 of the Website Diagram
- Challenges: 

1) On the main.html - I have not yet figured out how to get the icons to appear in the bottom navigation bar. It's probably something simple, but I just haven't seen it yet. The link works though. 

2) I had trouble writing html code for Page 2 of the Website Diagram because there are three search forms, and each form is in it's own column, all adjacent to each other. I wondered if this is a good programming practice to have multiple forms in a single page because I could not remember seeing it before. I thought about splitting up the page into three pages - one for each search form. However, it seems to be doable based on my search on various StackOverflow posts and that the button needs to be unique from all others. Then the next challenge was trying the form so I drew it and then turned it into psuedocode. 
- Tools used: Sublime Text and paper and a sharpie
