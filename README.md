# e-vote
Documenting E-VOTE! for OSU CS 406 - Projects (and beyond).

The repository will be uploaded on a regular bases to show my progression.

NOTES
# July 2, 2020
- All candidates, positions, election days are accurate. Their personal information, especially SSN, are fictional and generated by a random generator found online. The same goes for Voters. Addresses may or may not be fictional but are close to being as accurate as possible to be realistic.
- Phone/cell datatype is now char(15) so numbers can be properly entered, including international numbers
- Zipcode datatype is now Char to capture the leading zero (i.e. 07373 would be entered as 7373 with Int)
